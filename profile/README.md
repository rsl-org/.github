# The **R**eflective **S**upport **L**ibrary project
The goal of this project is to give you a sneak peek at tomorrow's libraries by using C++26 reflection to its fullest extent.

The reflective support library project consist of several subprojects. You can use the primary [**rsl**](https://github.com/rsl-org/rsl) meta-repository to pull in all subprojects.

## Subprojects
| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**rsl**](https://github.com/rsl-org/rsl) | Meta repository containing all rsl subprojects |
| [**rsl::test**](https://github.com/rsl-org/test) | A reflective unit test framework |
| [**rsl::doc**](https://github.com/rsl-org/doc) | A reflective code documentation tool |
| [**rsl::config**](https://github.com/rsl-org/config) | A reflective command line argument and config library |
